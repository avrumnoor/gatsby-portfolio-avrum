description: "Many of you probably have heard of React, Angular, and Vue. They're popular JavaScript frameworks that many professional web developers use to build fancy websites with ground-breaking functionalities and smooth animations. They also make web development fun, easy, and accessible to everyone. However, did you know that there are other frameworks that are much easier than React, Angular, and Vue, some of which are based on programming languages other than JavaScript? Check out my favourite non-popular, simple-to-use web development frameworks in this article."

Many of you probably have heard of React, Angular, and Vue. They're popular JavaScript frameworks that many professional web developers use to build fancy websites with ground-breaking functionalities and smooth animations. They also make web development fun, easy, and accessible to everyone. However, did you know that there are other frameworks that are much easier than React, Angular, and Vue, some of which are based on programming languages other than JavaScript? Here's 3 other web development frameworks you may never have heard of.

# 1. Jekyll

![jekyll_logo](https://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png) Jekyll is one of the most beginner-friendly web development frameworks out there. Itâ€™s written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder. Since it's written by Github's co-founder, it's only right that it's a built-in feature within Github. And that's exactly what Jekyll is: it's web development framework that can directly be used within Github to convert any markdown style files you have within your Github repository into web pages or articles that you can host with Github Pages for free.

My only real complaint of Jekyll is that the layouts are too simple and they lack the flair that many modern sites have. However,
if you're interested in building professional company websites without having to work with databases, then Jekyll's the way to go.

# 2. Hugo

# 3. Gatsby
