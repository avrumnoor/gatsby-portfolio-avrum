They're popular JavaScript frameworks that many professional web developers use to build fancy websites with ground-breaking functionalities and smooth animations. They also make web development fun, easy, and accessible to everyone.

Many of you probably have heard of React, Angular, and Vue. They're popular JavaScript frameworks that many professional web developers use to build fancy websites with ground-breaking functionalities and smooth animations. They also make web development fun, easy, and accessible to everyone. However, did you know that there are other frameworks that are much easier than React, Angular, and Vue, some of which are based on programming languages other than JavaScript? Here are 3 other web development frameworks you may never have heard of.

# 1. Jekyll

![jekyll_logo](https://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png) Jekyll is one of the most beginner-friendly web development frameworks out there. Itâ€™s written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder. Since it's written by Github's co-founder, it's only right that it's a built-in feature within Github. And that's exactly what Jekyll is: it's web development framework that can directly be used within Github to convert any MarkDown files you have within your Github repository into web pages or articles that you can host with Github Pages for free.

My only real complaint of Jekyll is that the boilerplate templates they offer are too simple and lack the flair that many modern sites have. The tools they give you to build your site are also somewhat limited. However, if you're interested in building professional company websites without having to work with databases, then Jekyll's the way to go.

# 2. Hugo

![hugo_logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Logo_of_Hugo_the_static_website_generator.svg/440px-Logo_of_Hugo_the_static_website_generator.svg.png)Hugo is arguably my favorite framework on this list. Originally written in Go and created by Steve Francia in 2013, Hugo has had quite the updgrade in both features and performance over the past few years. They offer a wide variety of boilerplate templates, spanning from personal portfolios and travel blogs to professional company websites. They also provide great documentation and guide on how to use the templates. With the tools that Hugo gives you, you'll have a lot of freedom when it comes to building websites. Don't believe me? Just ask Smashing Magazine; in 2017, the company migrated from WordPress to Hugo and never looked back ever since! My favorite boilerplate template from Hugo is Origin.

The only thing I don't like about Hugo is that you'll have to be familiar with using a command-line interface and package installers like Homebrew or npm. I've also experienced some difficulty switching from one template to another. But if you're interested in building a personal porfolio with possibly a blog, then you should definitely give Hugo a try.

# 3. Gatsby
