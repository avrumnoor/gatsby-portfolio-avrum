They're popular JavaScript frameworks that many professional web developers use to build fancy websites with ground-breaking functionalities and smooth animations.

Many of you probably have heard of React, Angular, and Vue. They're popular JavaScript frameworks that many professional web developers use to build fancy websites with ground-breaking functionalities and smooth animations. They also make web development fun, easy, and accessible to everyone. However, did you know that there are other frameworks that are much easier than React, Angular, and Vue, some of which are based on programming languages other than JavaScript? Here are 3 other web development frameworks you may never have heard of.

# 1. Jekyll

![jekyll_logo](https://jekyllrb.com/img/logo-2x.png) Jekyll is one of the most beginner-friendly web development frameworks out there. Itâ€™s written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder. Since it's written by GitHub's co-founder, it's only right that it's a built-in feature within GitHub. And that's exactly what Jekyll is: it's web development framework that can directly be used within GitHub to convert any MarkDown files you have within your GitHub repository into web pages or articles that you can host with GitHub Pages for free.

My only real complaint of Jekyll is that the boilerplate templates they offer are too simple and lack the flair that many modern sites have. The tools they give you to build your site are also somewhat limited. However, if you're interested in building professional company websites without having to work with databases, then Jekyll's the way to go.

# 2. Hugo

![hugo_logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Logo_of_Hugo_the_static_website_generator.svg/440px-Logo_of_Hugo_the_static_website_generator.svg.png) Hugo is arguably my favorite framework on this list. Originally written in Go and created by Steve Francia in 2013, Hugo has had quite the updgrade in both features and performance over the past few years. They offer a wide variety of boilerplate templates, spanning from personal portfolios and travel blogs to professional company websites. They also provide great documentation and guide on how to use the templates. With the tools that Hugo gives you, you'll have a lot of freedom when it comes to building websites. Don't believe me? Just ask Smashing Magazine; in 2017, the company migrated from WordPress to Hugo and never looked back ever since! The Hugo framework is so fast and easy to use that even the Stanford Computer Science Department uses it to build their course websites. Just ask [Ryan Eberhardt](https://reberhardt.com/)! (Tell him I sent you.)

My favorite boilerplate template from Hugo is Origin.

The only thing I don't like about Hugo is that you'll have to be familiar with using a command-line interface and package installers like Homebrew or npm. I've also experienced some difficulty switching from one template to another. But if you're interested in building a personal porfolio with possibly a blog, then you should definitely give Hugo a try.

# 3. Gatsby

![gatsby_logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fda3jJaA--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_320,q_auto,w_320/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/organization/profile_image/2653/80840bff-1061-4544-841e-86da7aa1dd8e.png)Gatsby's the most fun framework in this list in my opinion. It's relatively new and
is built on top of React, so it's very easy to use once you're familiar with React. It also offers an assortment of templates, some of which work very well with content management systems like Netlify. Gatsby also has their own deployment system for you
to deploy your Gatsby site called Gatsby Cloud that you can sync with GitHub. Once synced with GitHub, Gatsby Cloud will automatically redeploy your site whenever you make changes to it. My favorite part about Gatsby is how fast your website loads, thanks to Gatsby's ability to automate code splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, prefetching resources.

My only complaint is that the boilerplate templates Gatsby offers you may have some bugs and instructions on how to deploy is rather unclear. Often times, you're left figuring things out on your own. But most bugs are minor and if you're deployed a static site before and have used a content manage system before, the benefits of Gatsby are yours to reap!

Web development is evolving and there is an increasing numbers of ways for you to create a website, regardless of whether you're simply trying to increase your online presence or create the next Facebook. With web development becoming more and more accessible and sophisticated at the same time, there wouldn't be any better time to make yourself a website than now.
