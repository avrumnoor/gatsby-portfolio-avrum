description: "β’’-aluminas are commonly used in flow batteries. However, a huge uncertainty still remains on the effects of
structural defects in the electrolyte on ionic transport and therefore, cell performance. Taking advantage of
modern molecular dynamics simulations reveals that the symmetry of defects can affect diffusion mechanisms,
particularly the preferential vacancy sites of mobile ions, regardless of temperature."

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
