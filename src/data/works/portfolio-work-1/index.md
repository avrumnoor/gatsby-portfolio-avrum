description: "β’’-aluminas are commonly used in flow batteries. However, a huge uncertainty still remains on the effects of
structural defects in the electrolyte on ionic transport and therefore, cell performance. Taking advantage of
modern molecular dynamics simulations reveals that the symmetry of defects can affect diffusion mechanisms,
particularly the preferential vacancy sites of mobile ions, regardless of temperature."

# Mentors

Dr. Andrey Poletayev, Professor Aaron Lindenberg

# Introduction

- Solid electrolytes such as β’’-aluminas are a central part of flow batteries.

- β’’-aluminas are used as a model system to understand thermally-activated conduction.

- In β’’-aluminas, the existence of multiple Ea are related to the ordering of mobile ions and the placement of defects.

# Methods

- Objective: to understand conduction by controllably perturbing the positions of defects and applying detailed microscopic analyses of molecular dynamics.

- Chose Buckingham potential model, plus a long-range Coulomb force (Hafskjold and Li, 1995).

- No. of atoms: 10680; No. of mobile ions: 600; Duration of simulation: 10ns; Timestep used: 1e-15 seconds.

- Defect positions investigated:

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
